<div>
  <p>This is a quick and dirty introduction to Ink: a framework for 2D graphics in Go, focused on creative coding, and based on OpenGL.</p>

  <p><em>Disclaimer:</em> Although I've been working towards Ink for years, the project is still very young in many ways. There are many TODOs, bugs, and ugly APIs. I will rewrite and break and (hopefully) improve things over time.</p>


  <p>There's more that doesn't have examples here. Check out the <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/buchanae/ink">docs</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/buchanae/ink/tree/master/sketches">sketches directory</a>, or just browse through <a href="https://github.com/buchanae/ink">the code</a>.</p>

  <h2>Usage</h2>

  <div>
    <p>You'll need <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> installed. These docs assume the reader is familiar with programming in Go.</p>

    <p>Install ink:</p>
    <p><span class="code">go get github.com/buchanae/ink</span></p>

    <p>(I'm <em>pretty</em> that should work for you, but if it doesn't please let me know by <a href="https://github.com/buchanae/ink/issues/new">filing a github issue</a>. If nothing else, you can clone the code and run <span class="code">go install .</span> from the root directory.)</p>

    <p>Use the "ink" CLI to run a sketch file. This will open a window,
     draw the sketch, and watch for changes.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Hello, Triangle</h2>
  <p>The "hello, world" of graphics: a triangle with different colored vertices.</p>

  {{ "hello_triangle" | Example }}
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Basic Shapes</h2>
  <p>The "dd" (like "two d") package holds all the 2D geometry types, and the "gfx" package holds things like "Fill".</p>

  {{ "basic_shapes" | Example }}

<section>
  <h2>Grid</h2>

  <p>Grids are one of the types I find most useful. This replica of a piece by George Nees demonstrates the Grid utility.</p>

  {{ "grid" | Example }}
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Paths</h2>
  <p>Paths are a little broken and buggy at the moment.</p>

  {{ "paths" | Example }}

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Palettes</h2>
  <p>Ink has a bunch of color palettes built in.</p>

  {{ "palettes" | Example }}

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Image</h2>
  {{ "image" | Example }}
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Instances</h2>
  <p>Use OpenGL instancing to efficiently repeat the same shape many times.</p>
  {{ "instances" | Example }}
</section>

  <h2>Blue Noise</h2>
  {{ "blue_noise" | Example }}

<section>
  <h2>Voronoi</h2>
